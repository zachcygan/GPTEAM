## Description

As fullstack students, our team found it very important to have a resource available to us that would provide insider's feedback on getting prepared in work industry
Project Perfect allows users to upload resumes and coverletters to a community that can potentially offer invaluable insider information. Users are also able to post questions to get prepared for interviews or anything they might need to know about their target industry.
Unlike job posting sites/job boards which focus on finding positions to apply for, our application provides the users a community that may be hard to find elsewhere that can get their application documents in the best shape possible
In order to get this application operational it required us to use our knowledge of express and sequelize to get a database running on the server side that can handle user accounts and their posts. In addition, we needed to allow users to upload documents, which required offsite storage. For this we needed to use AWS S3 buckets, which had quite the learning curve..

## Installation



## Usage

After a user creates an account. They can create their own posts that can include a relevant document for critique (such as a Resume or Cover letter) or post without a document just for a general inquiry to be answered by their community. In addition they can view other people's posts and commnent to add their own insight. Posts can be created on both the Post page or directly on the profile page. Old posts can be deleted by a user, if they are no longer needed or relevant. In addition the Chat bot which can be accessed on all pages in the lower right hand corner can offer very great general insight with a quick response time.
